# Contributing to Validra

Welcome to **Validra**! üöÄ 

We're just getting started building the fastest, zero-dependency business rules engine for JavaScript and TypeScript. Since we're in the very beginning of development, your contributions will help shape the entire project from the ground up.

## üöß Current Development Status

**Validra is in initial planning and development phase.** We haven't written the first line of code yet! We're currently:

- üîÑ Defining project architecture
- üîÑ Planning API design
- üîÑ Establishing development workflows
- üîÑ Setting up project infrastructure
- ‚è≥ Creating initial implementation plan

## üåü How You Can Help Right Now

Since we're at the very beginning, here are the most valuable ways to contribute:

### üèóÔ∏è Project Planning
- **Architecture discussions** - Help design the overall structure
- **API design brainstorming** - Shape how developers will use Validra
- **Feature prioritization** - Help decide what to build first
- **Technology decisions** - Contribute to tooling and setup choices

### üìù Requirements & Feedback
- **Use case scenarios** - Share your business rules requirements
- **Performance expectations** - Help us set realistic targets
- **Integration needs** - Tell us how you'd want to use this
- **API preferences** - What would make this easy to use?

### üß™ Planning & Strategy
- **Test strategy planning** - How should we approach testing?
- **Documentation planning** - What docs will users need?
- **Browser compatibility** - What environments should we support?
- **Performance benchmarks** - What should we measure?

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0
- **npm** >= 8.0.0
- Interest in business rules engines
- Willingness to help shape a project from scratch

### Initial Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/validra.git
   cd validra
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Explore the Project**
   ```bash
   # Look at the current project structure
   # Read through existing documentation
   # Check out open issues and discussions
   ```

## ü§ù Contribution Process

### 1. Start with Discussions

Since we're in planning phase:
- **Open issues** to propose ideas or discuss architecture
- **Join existing discussions** about project direction  
- **Share your experience** with similar tools or use cases
- **Ask questions** about project goals and scope

### 2. Types of Contributions Needed

#### Planning & Design
- Architecture proposals
- API design suggestions
- Feature specifications
- Performance requirements

#### Documentation
- Project documentation structure
- Contributing guidelines improvements
- User story definitions
- Technical specification drafts

#### Research & Analysis
- Competitive analysis of existing solutions
- Performance benchmarking strategies
- Technology stack recommendations
- Best practices research

### 3. Workflow

```bash
# Create branch for your contribution
git checkout -b proposal/your-idea-name

# Add your contribution (documents, proposals, etc.)
# Focus on planning and design documents

# Commit with clear messages
git commit -m "docs: add API design proposal for rule validation"

# Push and create PR for discussion
git push origin proposal/your-idea-name
```

### 4. Commit Convention

We use **Conventional Commits**:

```bash
docs: documentation changes
feat: feature proposals/specifications  
chore: project maintenance
discuss: discussion topics or RFCs
plan: planning documents
research: research and analysis
```

## üí≠ Discussion Topics

### Current Open Questions
- What should the DSL syntax look like?
- How do we balance performance with flexibility?
- What's the ideal developer experience?
- Which use cases should we prioritize?
- How do we ensure zero dependencies while maximizing features?

### Areas for Input
1. **Business Rules Patterns** - What patterns do you commonly use?
2. **Performance Requirements** - What's fast enough for your use cases?
3. **API Design** - What would be intuitive for developers?
4. **Integration Scenarios** - How would you integrate this?
5. **Error Handling** - How should validation errors work?

## üìã Current Priorities

### Immediate Needs
- [ ] Finalize project architecture approach
- [ ] Define API design principles
- [ ] Establish development workflow
- [ ] Create technical specifications
- [ ] Plan initial feature set

### Next Steps
- [ ] Set up development environment standards
- [ ] Create testing strategy
- [ ] Plan documentation structure
- [ ] Define performance benchmarks

## üéØ Areas Needing Input

1. **Business Rules Experts** - Share domain knowledge
2. **API Designers** - Help create intuitive interfaces
3. **Performance Engineers** - Define optimization strategies
4. **Documentation Writers** - Plan user experience
5. **TypeScript Experts** - Guide type system design

## üìû Communication

- **GitHub Issues** - Main discussion platform
- **Pull Requests** - For proposals and documentation
- **Discussions** - For broader architectural conversations

## üôè Recognition

All contributors will be:
- **Listed as project contributors**
- **Credited in documentation**
- **Acknowledged in project decisions**
- **Part of shaping the project's future**

Since we're starting from absolute zero, early contributors will have massive impact on every aspect of the project.
