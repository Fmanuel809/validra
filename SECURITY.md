# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security at Validra

Security is a top priority for **Validra**. As a business rules engine that will handle critical validation logic, we take security vulnerabilities seriously and are committed to ensuring the safety of our users and their applications.

## 🚨 Supported Versions

Since **Validra** is currently in active development and hasn't reached its first stable release, we will provide security updates for:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| master  | ✅ (development)   |
| < 1.0.0 | ⚠️ (pre-release)   |

**Note:** Once we release version 1.0.0, we will update this policy to reflect our long-term support strategy.

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Current Development Phase

During our current development phase, we are:

- **Designing with security in mind** from the ground up
- **Planning secure defaults** for all configurations
- **Considering threat models** for business rules engines
- **Following secure coding practices** in our implementation

### Planned Security Features

- **Input validation** - Comprehensive sanitization of rule definitions
- **Safe evaluation** - Sandboxed execution of business rules
- **Memory safety** - Protection against memory-based attacks
- **Injection prevention** - Protection against code injection in DSL
- **Access controls** - Secure rule management and execution

## 📢 Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability in Validra, please help us maintain a secure ecosystem by reporting it responsibly:

**🔐 Private Disclosure (Preferred)**

Send an email to: **felixmanuel396@gmail.com**

**Alternative Contact**

Until we have a dedicated security email, please:
1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. **Do NOT** discuss the vulnerability publicly
3. Contact the maintainer directly through GitHub private messages
4. Send details to the project maintainer's email if available

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description** - Clear explanation of the vulnerability
- **Impact** - Potential security impact and affected components
- **Reproduction** - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment** - Version, OS, Node.js version, etc.
- **Proof of Concept** - Code or screenshots (if applicable)
- **Suggested Fix** - Your ideas for remediation (if any)

### Response Timeline

We commit to:

- **24 hours** - Initial acknowledgment of your report
- **72 hours** - Preliminary assessment and severity classification
- **7 days** - Detailed response with our remediation plan
- **30 days** - Security fix released (for confirmed vulnerabilities)

## 🔍 Security Assessment Process

### Vulnerability Classification

We use the following severity levels:

- **🔴 Critical** - Immediate threat requiring emergency response
- **🟠 High** - Significant risk requiring urgent attention
- **🟡 Medium** - Moderate risk with planned remediation
- **🟢 Low** - Minor risk with standard timeline

### Our Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment** - We confirm receipt of your report
2. **Investigation** - We analyze and reproduce the vulnerability
3. **Classification** - We assess severity and impact
4. **Development** - We create and test a security fix
5. **Disclosure** - We coordinate responsible disclosure
6. **Release** - We deploy the fix and notify users

## 🏆 Security Recognition

### Hall of Fame

We will maintain a security researchers hall of fame to recognize contributors who help make Validra more secure:

- *[To be populated as we receive reports]*

### Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:

- **Credit researchers** who report vulnerabilities responsibly
- **Coordinate disclosure** timing with the reporting party
- **Provide advance notice** to users before public disclosure
- **Maintain transparency** about security improvements

## 🛠️ Security Best Practices

### For Users (Future Guidelines)

When Validra is ready for production use, we recommend:

- **Keep updated** - Always use the latest stable version
